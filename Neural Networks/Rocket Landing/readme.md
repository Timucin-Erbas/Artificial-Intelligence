Rocket Landing

One of the most crucial parts of space flight is landing. One real danger while doing that is landing on uneven terrain, causing the rocket to tilt, damage its boosters etc. In order to prevent this, I developed an AI algorithm to identify uneven, rocky terrain on extraterrestrial surfaces. The algorithm presents potential landing spots, and the most reccomended spot without maneuvering the rocket too much. In the output, the yellow cross-heir is where the rocket is currently heading, the red dots indicate dangerous terrain. The green squares represent safe landing spots, and the yellow highlighted square is the reccomended landing site.
